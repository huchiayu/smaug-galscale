Data for results from single-zone tests to determine behavior of 
coupling between code and Grackle. Tests should be performed with
hydrodynamics and gravity turned off, allowing iteration over 
Grackle alone, following the temperature evolution as a
function of time.


Report data here in units of:
Time         -      Myr
Temperature  -  T / mu 


Test 1: (*need better naming convention if running many of these)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

rho / m_p = 1.0    cc
T   / mu  = 1.0E5  
Z         = 0.002  metal fraction  (so 0.01 Z_sun)

run for 1 Gyr using log-space output starting with
dt = 1.0E4 yr**

** Enzo test used dt = 1.0E3 yr to start, with 10 outputs
   per dex in time. Also I set max time step to
   dt / 100.0, but this may not matter much
